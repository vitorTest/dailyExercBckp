Trying to extract a flag from a image (esquisita_50_forensis.jpg).

Probably it has a Alternate Data Stream (ADS) inside it. But it comes
from NTFS (Windows) features and I don't know how to extract it from
Linux.
I found the command:
> 7z e -sns esquisita_50_forensis.jpg

It extracts a file 'ctf.jpg' that only can be open with a text editor...
But there's nothing insid it. 
When I extract from 'esquisita_50_forensis.jpg' I get the message:
% ERROR: Unsupported Method : ctf.jpg
If I verify the file, only get the message
% ctf.jpg: empty

I don't how to do it, so I'm going to approach it with xxd.
There are two files ctf.jpg and ctf2.jpg, that I found by
> xxd esquisita_50_forensis1.jpg | grep ctf
It means that I could have did:
> strings esquisita_50_forensis1.jpg | grep "ct"
Yep.
Probably the flag is inside the ctf2.jpg, but I'm not able to extract it

ctf2.jpg:
0001c123
00022ae9

> xxd -s 0x1c123 -l 0x69ce esquisita_50_forensis1.jpg

I found a Rar! signature (52 61 72 21 1A 07 00). So I just removed the
file for esquisita_50_forensis.rar and extracted the files ctf.jpg.

There's nothing inside this image.
