In html source you can find the file:
src="100security.swf"

In browser you can access:
http://www.100security.com.br/wargame/100security.swf
or
wget http://www.100security.com.br/wargame/100security.swf
or 
curl -o 100security.swf http://www.100security.com.br/wargame/100security.swf


Decompile flash file. I've used:
$ swfmill swf2xml 100security.swf decom.xml

The installation was very tiring, the second time that
I don't configurate a path, so I run this, was like that:
./swfmill swf2xml ../../../vytor2repos/dailyExercBckp/100security/100security.swf ../../../vytor2repos/dailyExercBckp/100security/decompressed.xml

For Kali you'll have to install a lot of packages
