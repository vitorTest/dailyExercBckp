I wanted to do it with ls and grep... But it seems simpler just doing a
find... So it becomes very easy

> find / -user bandit6 -group bandit6

Between a lot of "Permission denied" messages I could find:
/var/lib/dpkg/info/bandit7.password

It didn't even have to set the -size parameter. 
But there's a lot of "Permission denied" messages polluting the output
(at least in this case).
Using 
>  find ... | grep -v 'Permission'
with find, is not working. Probably the command find prints first the
"Permission denied" regardless grep. It most have to be some option
in find command to omit such messages.

I find it:

And I'll not to explain the post here. So I could use:

> find / -user bandit7 -group bandit6 2>&1 | grep -v 'Permission' | grep -v 'No'
To get rid of the "Permission" and the "No such file" messages.

Or shorting it:

> find / -user bandit7 -group bandit6 2>&1 | grep -v 'Permission\|No'
