notes:

find . -type f -size 1033c ! -executable -exec file {} + | grep ASCII

Find here the type file (f), with the size of 1033c bytes, and if this file
is not(!) an executable (-executable).

Then execute (-exec) the file command with the files that are already filtered
({}) by 'find' and also execute it in paralel (+ |) with the command
'grep', to filter if that file is a 'ASCII' type.
