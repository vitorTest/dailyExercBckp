We have to find where:

    human-readable
    1033 bytes in size
    not executable

By the last challenge we know that how to find 'Human-readable' (at least
something very close to that).
Now due the big number of folders and files we'll have to use find.

By the man find, we know that we could do '-exec command {} +', that
allied with find, solves the "Human-readable'. But this in itself is
the same as only list the files with file and grep. We've to use find 
efficciently.

We know that we're going to search for a file, so -type c... That's
already default kkk

Remembering that to search in man, press '/'. It accepts regular 
expressions.

-executable
              Matches files which are executable and directories  which
              are  searchable  (in a file name resolution sense) by the
              current user.
For a NO executable we have the option -not "Same as !".

-size n[cwbkMG]
              File uses n units of space, rounding up.
	      (SEE ALL THE OPTION at the MAN)

So we have all that we need. Actually I only made it to find:
> find . -size 1033c -exec cat {} +

But to find it using the full command:
> find . -size 1033c ! -executable -exec file {} + | grep text
