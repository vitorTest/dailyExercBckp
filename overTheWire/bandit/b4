To be quick I only did
> file ./-*

The unique type of text between the files was '-file07', doing cat in it
you can find the flag

But only human is a very questionable term. Since at the description of
text files generaly we have the word 'text' at the description, we can
verify all the files and grep only where this word appears

> file ./* | grep text
