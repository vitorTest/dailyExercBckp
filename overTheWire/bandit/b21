with tmux I could create another section:
tmux new -s netcat

then started a nc service:
echo "passOf20Level" | nc -l -p 65000
#choose from the range of 1023-65535

So I detach the section (Ctrl-b(wait for it) + d) and connect with the script:
./script my_port

Then reattach:
tmux attach-session -t netcat

It's quicker:
$ tmux new
$ 'creat nc server'
$ Ctrl+b + % #create new section
$ ./suconnect 65000
