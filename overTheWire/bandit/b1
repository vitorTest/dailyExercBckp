A Dashed-filenamed file.

If you try to read the file -, it will be interpreted (by bash) as an 
argument for the command.

A word from the experts:
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
Using - as a filename to mean stdin/stdout is a convention that a lot 
of programs use. It is not a special property of the filename. 
The kernel does not recognise - as special so any system calls 
referring to - as a filename will use - literally as the filename.

With bash redirection, - is not recognised as a special filename, 
so bash will use that as the literal filename.

When cat sees the string - as a filename, it treats it as a synonym 
for stdin. [...] {camh}

-----------------------------------------------------------------------

Solution:
"Alter the string that cat sees in such a way that it still refers
to a file called -" 
"Prefix the filename with a path":
> cat ./-

It's important to know, that this solution (Give the path) also works 
for another clash with filenames!
