Use BurpSuit to intercept the package.
I've to learn how to get more information in Burp, because I'd to use
wireshark to see more information about the package.

It's a little confusing, because the magic_number is given in the 
step 3, but I was thinking that it was at the step 2... It got me some
time.

The magic number is in the step 3. In my case it was:
method: POST
magic_number: 30
