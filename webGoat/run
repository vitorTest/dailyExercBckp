java -jar webgoat-server-8.0.0.M25.jar [--server.port=8080] [--server.address=localhost]

Once installed connect to 
http://localhost:8080/WebGoat and 
http://localhost:9090/WebWolf

I can't save the pattern, so:
prizefighter
changeit

I Give up my old version, still needs java 8 and to adapt that would
be very  painful. So I downloaded the latest version on:

https://github.com/WebGoat/WebGoat/releases

I decided to use the container, because I wanna.
So to install docker I followed (This is on Kali):
https://github.com/vitorTest/docking/blob/master/linuxTips/inst-basicUse

Get very wrong and now I can't update kkk... So let's rm that:
sudo rm /etc/apt/sources.list.d/docker.list

Now I have to decide if I'll to continue investing in docker...
Maybe I need it in future... 
But I want to set up webGoat and have a little time, so I'll get
back in the easiest way, by running with Java.

Download the latest version...
Give the command at the beginning of the file.


-----------------------Old version---------------------------------------
I already forget all about how to run it. 
So let's keep some notes.

java --add-modules java.xml.bind -jar webgoat-server-8.0.0.VERSION.jar.
