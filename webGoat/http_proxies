I'm going to try ZAP, that's the proxy used at the lesson.

Download and install:
https://github.com/zaproxy/zaproxy/wiki/Downloads
I've downloaded ZAP_2_8_0_unix.sh
> sudo ./ZAP...
Installed at the /opt/zaproxy

I've finished it. I get some time to realize that changing the
method from POST to GET, I also had to change the URL... It was lame kk
