It start with a CMS sketch.

I'll to create a new page and insert <script>alert('xss');</script>,
in the text field. Nothing.

Now I'm going to try to do the same at the title. Yep, it works.
The script is rendered at the home page:
^FLAG^c14f96498f3fc6d81ecc5beced51bb92a85ec154ea7818b2ba4e8870e8615146$FLAG$

Now I'm going to test as far as title box prevents XSS:
hello <a name="n" href="javascript:alert('xss')">*you*</a>
I find the same flag, when accessing home.
And the link becomes broken.
There's a warning: "Markdown is supported, but scripts are not".
Well, the tag script is filtered... But can we insert JS in another tag?
The site itself shows an example of a button... So let's test it:
<button onclick="alert(1)">Click me</button> 
It works, but it almost tricks me because besides the other flags, this
one is found only at the source code.

Now let's try some injection. At the edit page we can see a link:
http://34.74.105.127/c129446045/page/edit/1
So only testing:
http://34.74.105.127/c129446045/page/edit/1'
generated the third flag.

There's a strange behaviour when it's created a new page... It starts
by the page 12... If there's already the page 1 and 2, why not to 
continues by the page 3? I'm going to access pages 3 up to 11.
I found only one page (5), that have a 403-Forbidden acceess message.
So, let's try to edit this page since we know the pattern of the URL
for edition: http://34.94.3.143/891d57468e/page/edit/5.
And there's the flag :)
